# üìä Financial Loan Data Analysis 

## üßæ Overview
This project analyzes financial loan data to gain a deeper understanding of borrower demographics, loan performance, and repayment behavior. Using Microsoft Excel, it transforms raw financial data into interactive, data-driven insights through structured cleaning, processing, and dashboard design.

The analysis examines key financial parameters such as loan amount, interest rate, annual income, employment length, credit grade, and debt-to-income ratio, uncovering relationships between these variables and repayment outcomes.

By leveraging Excel‚Äôs advanced analytical features‚ÄîPivot Tables, Power Query, dynamic charts, and slicers‚Äîthe project visualizes critical metrics including loan distribution by grade and term, default risk by income category, and repayment trends over time.

This approach not only enables users to explore the data interactively but also supports data-informed decision-making by identifying patterns that influence credit risk and financial stability. Ultimately, the project serves as a complete loan portfolio analysis system, capable of highlighting profitable segments, potential risks, and key performance indicators within a financial dataset.

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Analyze loan performance and repayment patterns.  
- Visualize loan distribution by grade, term, and state.  
- Identify trends in interest rates and borrower income.  
- Evaluate the relationship between employment, income, and loan defaults.  
- Build a dashboard for decision-making in the finance domain.

## üìà Key Insights (Detailed Analysis)

- **Higher Credit Grades (A‚ÄìC) correlate with lower interest rates and better repayment history**  
  Credit grades represent borrower creditworthiness. A-grade borrowers are considered low-risk, so lenders offer lower interest rates. The dashboard shows a clear trend where higher grades correlate with timely repayments and lower default rates, reflecting the influence of credit scores on lending decisions.

- **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) strongly affects loan approval and performance**  
  The DTI ratio measures how much of a borrower‚Äôs income goes toward debt repayment. A higher DTI indicates greater financial pressure, often linked to delayed payments or defaults. Maintaining a lower DTI improves loan approval chances and repayment success.

- **Renters show higher loan application frequency but slightly elevated default risk**  
  Borrowers who rent homes often have less collateral and lower financial stability than homeowners. Renters tend to apply for more loans but also have a higher likelihood of default, indicating a potential risk segment within the borrower population.

- **Long-term loans (60 months) tend to carry higher interest rates and larger amounts**  
  Lenders charge higher interest on longer-term loans to offset extended risk exposure. These loans usually involve higher principal amounts, leading to increased overall repayment values. The dashboard comparison between 36- and 60-month loans visually confirms this relationship.

- **Dashboard filters enhance dynamic financial exploration**  
  Interactive slicers and filters allow users to explore the data across dimensions such as loan grade, term, and state. This interactivity supports real-time segmentation and helps identify trends, risk zones, and profitable borrower groups.

## üíª How to Use

1. **Open the Excel file**  
   Launch the file `Copy of financial_loan_data_excel.xlsx` in Microsoft Excel (ensure that macros and Pivot Table features are enabled).

2. **Explore the `SUMMARY DASHBOARD` tab**  
   Provides a snapshot of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan count, total repayment, and average interest rate. Ideal for a quick, high-level overview of portfolio performance.

3. **Use filters and slicers for deeper analysis**  
   Apply interactive filters by loan grade, term, or borrower state to analyze specific segments and identify trends within the dataset.

4. **Switch to the `OVERVIEW DASHBOARD` tab**  
   Offers detailed analytics, including borrower segmentation, loan term comparisons, and repayment distributions. Supports granular exploration of loan data and borrower characteristics.

5. **Access the `financial_loan` sheet**  
   Contains the cleaned and structured dataset used to power the dashboards. Users can view raw loan-level information and perform custom analyses.

## üìä Dashboard Preview (Analytical Highlights)

- **Total Loans Issued**  
  Displays the total number of approved loans ‚Äî a key metric for measuring loan volume and growth.

- **Average Interest Rate (%)**  
  Represents the overall cost of borrowing. Helps identify market competitiveness and risk-based pricing across borrower groups.

- **Total Amount Repaid**  
  Sums all repayments, offering a quick view of cash inflows and repayment efficiency across the loan portfolio.

- **Loan Grade Distribution**  
  Visualizes how loans are allocated across grades (A‚ÄìG). Useful for understanding credit risk distribution and exposure concentration.

- **Loan Term Breakdown (36 vs 60 months)**  
  Compares short-term and long-term loans, showing how loan duration influences repayment amount, interest rate, and total risk.

- **Borrower Income vs Interest Rate Correlation**  
  Highlights the relationship between borrower income and loan pricing, demonstrating that higher-income borrowers often receive lower interest rates due to lower perceived risk.
